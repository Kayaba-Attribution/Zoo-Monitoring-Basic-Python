This is the first project that I made on python I learned how to do it in JetBrains Academy

The code is very straigh-foward.
* Gives the user a list of animals with an individual number for each one of them
* It ask for an int (the number corresponding to the animal you wish to see)
* It prints out the animal and a little message
* It repeats on a loop until the user types exit

Behind the scenes:
* All the images of animals are binded to variables named by the animal name
Ex: rabbit = *Image of the rabbit*
* A list is created with this animals
* A loop starts with a while true statement
* It prints an index
* Takes the input, converts it to an int and prints the varible associated with that number on the list
* If the user types exit the loop ends
